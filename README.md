# FarmBot :warning:  WIP
A bot for my free farm, aiming to do stuff automatic.

‚ùó Remember that doing bot stuff on your account will lead to an instant ban, once official game moderators have noticed.
This is a research and progression thing for me personally but it'll be released soon.

## Planned: 

Gameplay 'functions', which normally are triggered by a player clicking or interacting with the game inside the browser, are simulated using a [Webdriver] and on top of that, all those actions can be scripted using the [Pawn] scripting language.
For harvesting a single field to watering / planting all at once - everything has it's function. 
So imagine you have to loop 'x' through 1 to 120 and just call HarvestGarden(x) and done. 
But there are functions like HarvestAll, WaterAll and so on..

### Notes
 - I haven't found any limits calling the scripting functions in like a loop without wait/sleep
   - The reason is that most of the time I try to run the JS functons from the game itself, using INSPECT with the browser (easy af)
   
   1. One of the six spots on each farm is called a (Farm)position.
   2. A farm, any market, picknic place and all are called Locations.
   3. Factory stands for bakeries, cheese-factory and other (food-) processing
   4. Building or animal means any animal housing.
  
   #### State of project
   - Given my available free time, it is already possible to compile scripts. I won't be putting out a final executable.
   - I am willing to give away "private versions" though. (Meaning also that I won't be publishing ALL code, leaving out future planned stuff.
